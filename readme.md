## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Advanced Color Picking**
  - Hex, RGB, HSL, CMYK color formats
  - Dual color selection (primary/secondary)
  - Color harmony generation (complementary, analogous, triadic, etc.)
- **Image Color Extraction**

  - Upload images to extract dominant colors
  - Pixel-level color picking with magnifier
  - Automatic palette generation

- **Professional Tools**

  - WCAG contrast ratio checking
  - Color adjustment tools (lighten/darken, saturate/desaturate)
  - Gradient and color harmony previews

- **Workflow Integration**
  - Save and organize color palettes
  - Export to CSS, SCSS, JSON, and PNG
  - Copy color values in multiple formats

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Color Libraries**: TinyColor2, React Colorful
- **Utilities**: HTML2Canvas, FileSaver.js
- **Icons**: React Icons

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/color-studio.git
```

### Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies

## üé® How to Use

### Color Selection:

- Use the color picker or input values directly
- Toggle between primary/secondary colors
- Generate harmonious color schemes

### Image Processing:

- Save high-resolution PNGs of your color schemes

## üåü Why This Project Stands Out

- **Professional-Grade Features**: Goes beyond basic color pickers with tools designers actually need
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses React memoization and efficient color calculations
- **Pixel-Perfect UI**: Carefully crafted animations and transitions
- **Developer Experience**: Clean, well-commented code with TypeScript support

## üìö Learning Resources

This project implements several advanced concepts:

- Canvas manipulation for image color picking
- Complex color math algorithms
- Local storage persistence
- Responsive design principles
- Accessibility best practices
